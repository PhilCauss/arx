# Arx - Secure Yay Wrapper

Arx is a Python script that wraps around the `yay` package manager for Arch Linux, providing security analysis of packages before installation. It analyzes PKGBUILD files for malicious intent and checks package names for potential typosquatting.

## Features

- üîç **PKGBUILD Analysis**: Uses OpenAI to analyze PKGBUILD files for malicious intent
- üõ°Ô∏è **Package Name Analysis**: Detects potential typosquatting and suspicious naming patterns
- üìä **Security Scoring**: Provides a 0-100 security score for each package
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Malicious Intent Detection**: Identifies potentially harmful packages
- üéØ **Yay Compatibility**: Accepts all yay arguments and passes them through
- üîÑ **Interactive Prompts**: Asks for confirmation before proceeding with installation

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the script**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd arx
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x arx.py
   ```

4. **Set up OpenAI API key** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
   ```
   
   Or add it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
   
   **Note**: This script uses OpenAI API v1.0+ format. Make sure you have the latest version of the openai Python package.

## Usage

Arx works as a drop-in replacement for yay. All yay arguments are supported:

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install a package
./arx.py -S firefox

# Install multiple packages
./arx.py -S firefox vlc gimp

# Update system
./arx.py -Syu

# Search for packages
./arx.py -Ss firefox

# Remove packages
./arx.py -R firefox
```

### Examples

```bash
# Install a package with security analysis
./arx.py -S spotify

# Update all packages
./arx.py -Syu

# Install from AUR
./arx.py -S yay-git

# Remove packages
./arx.py -Rns firefox
```

## Security Analysis

Arx performs several types of security analysis:

### 1. PKGBUILD Analysis
- Analyzes PKGBUILD files for suspicious commands
- Checks for unusual network requests or downloads
- Identifies file system modifications outside package directory
- Detects execution of downloaded scripts
- Looks for hardcoded URLs or IP addresses

### 2. Package Name Analysis
- Detects potential typosquatting of popular packages
- Identifies suspicious naming patterns
- Checks for very short or very long package names
- Warns about packages with excessive numbers or characters

### 3. Security Scoring
- **0-39**: üî¥ High risk - Exercise extreme caution
- **40-69**: üü° Medium risk - Review carefully
- **70-100**: üü¢ Low risk - Generally safe

## Output Example

```
Packages to install: firefox

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for PKGBUILD analysis
- `ARX_TEMP_DIR`: Custom temporary directory for PKGBUILD analysis (optional)
- `ARX_DEBUG`: Set to `1` for debug output

### Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Add more suspicious patterns for package names
- Customize the security scoring algorithm
- Add additional analysis methods
- Modify the prompt for OpenAI analysis

### Temporary Directory Configuration

By default, arx creates temporary directories in the system's temp location (`$TMPDIR` or `/tmp`) for PKGBUILD analysis. You can customize this behavior:

```bash
# Use a custom temp directory (files will be preserved for inspection)
export ARX_TEMP_DIR="/home/user/arx_temp"

# Use system temp directory (files will be automatically cleaned up)
unset ARX_TEMP_DIR
```

**Note**: 
- **System temp**: Creates `/tmp/arx/arx_<package_name>/` directories and cleans them up after analysis
- **Custom temp**: Creates `/your/path/arx_<package_name>/` directories and cleans them up after analysis
- The `$TMPDIR` environment variable is respected if set, otherwise defaults to `/tmp`

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- `yay` package manager
- `openai` Python package
- `requests` Python package

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"yay not found" error**:
   - Make sure yay is installed: `sudo pacman -S yay`
   - Ensure yay is in your PATH

2. **OpenAI API errors**:
   - Check your API key is correct
   - Ensure you have sufficient API credits
   - Verify your OpenAI account is active

3. **Permission denied**:
   - Make the script executable: `chmod +x arx.py`
   - Run with proper permissions

4. **Package not found**:
   - The package might not exist in AUR or official repositories
   - Check the package name spelling

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by setting the environment variable:
```bash
export ARX_DEBUG=1
./arx.py -S firefox
```
